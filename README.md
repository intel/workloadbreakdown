# IntelÂ® Workload Breakdown
Drop-in eBPF analysis of distributed workloads. Generates a map of processes which communicate over TCP. Gets the following metrics per visualized process
- Network time
- Network data (kb sent and received)
-	CPU utilization
- Memory utilization

## How to use
1. Start collector container on all system with IP of controller node as an argument passed to the container
```
docker run -d --pid=host --userns=host --privileged intel/workload-breakdown-collector:latest <controller-node-ip>
```
2. Run controller (runs for 15 seconds)
```
wget https://github.com/intel/workloadbreakdown/releases/latest/download/controller -O controller
